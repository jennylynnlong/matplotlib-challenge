Jennifer Long's matplotlib homework.

In these files, you will find my matplotlib ipynb for the homework. At the bottom of the notebook, you will find observations regarding the effects of the drug regimens on the tumor-filled mice. I have also listed these observations below:

Three observations:
    1) It looks as though there is a correlation between how big a 
    tumor is and how big the mouse is. The larger the mouse, the larger
    the tumor. The r-squared value is 0.84 which proves there is a 
    strong correlation between tumor volume and mouse weight.
    
    2) Out of the drug regimens pulled out of the data (Ceftamin, 
    Infubinol, Ramicane, and Capomulin), Capomulin and Ramicane appear
    to be the most effective at decreasing or maintaining tumor volume
    in mice.
    
    3) Capomulin and Ramicane are the two lowest drug regimens amongst
    all drugs used in this study for standard deviation and variance
    which shows that these drugs are consistent in their effect on 
    tumors. 
    
    4) The study was evenly tested amongst all of the drug regimens as
    well as between male and female mice. It would be interesting to see 
    the correlation between age and tumor volume to see if younger mice 
    see better results from all or certain drug regimens than older
    mice.
